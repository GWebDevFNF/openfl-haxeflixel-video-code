# openfl-haxeflixel-video-code
This is my research on how to play videos in openfl haxeflixel (webm only supported)
# How To Setup
1. Download the Friday Night Funkin source code in https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin (make sure its the new file system otherwise you need to put extra code `which i have the solution for lol`)
2. Install actuate by doing `haxelib install actuate`
3. Install the extension-webm fork by doing `haxelib git extension-webm https://github.com/GrowtopiaFli/extension-webm`
4. It won't work lol so type the command `lime rebuild extension-webm windows`
(sry idk how to fix this for mac)
5. Download the zip of this repository and copy paste the files inside the `source` folder to your fnf source code `source` folder
